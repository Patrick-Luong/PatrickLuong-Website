        <div class="subheading mb-5">StatisticsðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Patrick Luong and I grew up in the Bay Area. As a kid, I always enjoyed playing basketball, listening to music, playing video games, and eating good food. I have a big family with six aunts and uncles, fourteen cousins, one brother, and my parents so I am very family-oriented. Growing up, I have always enjoyed selling and trading to get the best deal or make the most money. When I was younger, I used to sell and trade Yu-gi-oh cards with my friends to get the best cards possible. As I grew up, the passion for reselling continued as I started to sell candy, sneakers, and technology from craigslist. Now, I have started to resell hype beast items with brands such as supreme, bape, and off-white. Hype beast items arenâ€™t all the same as some items could be resold for much more profit than others. For example, a supreme box logo hoodie which retails for $158 could resell for $1000 whereas another supreme hoodie which retails for $158 could sell for $200.  With every hype beast purchase, I took a risk because not every hype beast item sold for a profit. I would always watch videos on YouTube to learn about what items were in the most demand so I could make the most money. The reselling business is very risky because hype beast itemâ€™s prices fluctuate all the time which taught me how to adapt because fashion trends always change.<br><br>

        I graduated from Berean Christian High School and started attending the University of California Riverside in 2017. Iâ€™m studying Statistics with a concentration of Quantitative management at the University of California Riverside. I am currently in my third year at the University of California and I plan to use my bachelors of science in Statistics to pursue a career in Actuarial Science.<br><br>

        I want to pursue a career in Actuarial Science because I find it to be very interesting. So what is an Actuary and what do they do? Actuaries are highly sought-after professionals who develop and communicate solutions for complex financial issues. Actuaries have a deep understanding of mathematics, statistics and business management. Actuaries help leaders make strategic decisions and consumers prepare for their future. Actuaries measure and manage risk. Actuaries help organizations plan for the future and protect themselves from loss. Actuaries work for and with businesses with a financial focus. Businesses including insurance-life, health, property-casualty, even pet insurance. Also, banking, investments, government, energy, e-commerce, marketing, employee benefits, product development, enterprise risk management, predictive analytics, consulting and more. I find actuarial science to be very interesting because it deals with risk management which relates reselling. The idea of using statistics to determine whether a risk is worth taking is fascinating because I could have used statistics to determine whether the risk of buying hype beast items was worth it. Not only is it useful for reselling, but in every day experiences too since risks are abundant and we take risk every day.
